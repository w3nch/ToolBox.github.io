# SOC Email Threat Analysis Methodology

### 1. Data Collection

    Goal: Gather all relevant data from the email for thorough analysis.
    Actions:
        Extract email headers, body, attachments, and embedded URLs.
        Ensure copies of the email and attachments are isolated in a secure environment (sandbox).

### 2. Email Header Analysis

    Goal: Identify inconsistencies, spoofing, or unauthorized sources.
    Actions:
        Check the Received, From, Return-Path, and Reply-To fields.
        Verify DKIM and SPF records:
            For DKIM: Verify the DKIM signature by checking against the sender’s public DNS records.
            For SPF: Check if the IP address matches the allowed servers in the SPF record.

### 3. URL Analysis

    Goal: Identify phishing links, malicious redirects, or C2 communications.
    Actions:
        Extract all URLs in the email body and attachments.
        Analyze URLs using:
            URL sandboxing tools (e.g., URLhaus, VirusTotal).
            Domain reputation tools to check for misspelled, new, or suspiciously aged domains.

### 4. Attachment Analysis

    Goal: Detect malicious files or embedded malware in email attachments.
    Actions:
        Perform Static Analysis:
            Analyze file type, structure, and strings for suspicious content or hardcoded indicators.
            Check hash against known databases (e.g., VirusTotal, threat intelligence feeds).
        Conduct Dynamic Analysis:
            Run the attachment in a sandbox environment to observe any malicious behaviors, network calls, or payload downloads.
        Scan for Macros or other embedded code in Office files or PDFs.

### 5. Behavioral and Threat Intelligence Correlation

    Goal: Determine if the email or its contents match known attack patterns or threat actor campaigns.
    Actions:
        Check IP addresses, domains, file hashes, and behavioral indicators against:
            Internal threat intelligence databases.
            External threat intelligence feeds (AbuseIPDB, Emerging Threats).
        Reference MITRE ATT&CK to map observed behaviors to known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

### 6. Cryptographic Integrity Verification

    Goal: Ensure email integrity and authenticity.
    Actions:
        Verify DKIM and SPF records for cryptographic integrity.
        For encrypted or signed emails (S/MIME), validate the sender’s certificate and the encryption status for tampering or forgery.

### 7. Logging and Monitoring

    Goal: Track and monitor for related activities in real-time to prevent further attacks.
    Actions:
        Enable logging of all activities related to suspicious emails:
            User interaction logs, network connections, and endpoint behavior.
            Any attempts to contact C2 domains or IP addresses.
        Integrate with SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) for real-time alerts and historical analysis.

### 8. Incident Response and Mitigation

    Goal: Contain, mitigate, and communicate threat details across the SOC.
    Actions:
        Quarantine the suspicious email and related attachments.
        Block malicious IPs, domains, and sender addresses.
        Notify relevant teams and, if necessary, escalate the incident.
        Report findings to enhance organizational threat intelligence.

### 9. End-User Awareness and Training

    Goal: Reduce the risk of user-initiated incidents.
    Actions:
        Send alerts to users about phishing attempts or email-based threats.
        Reinforce training on identifying and reporting suspicious emails.

### 10. Documentation and Retrospective Analysis

    Goal: Document the incident and refine future detection strategies.
    Actions:
        Document the full analysis, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and remediation steps.
        Review the incident with SOC teams to improve future detection and response capabilities.
